###### Scripts for length based scallop model


# full script original model 
	- compiled version of Dougie's code with no changes (weighted sum of squares)
	- parameterised 
	- only computed with Nelder-Mead at the moment 
	- initial fits are decent 
	- fishing selectivity not great
	- F too low and not capturing pattern 
	- Abundance probably a little too low 
	- Survey catchability is a diagonal straight line from 0.4 to 0.8
	- Survey predictions are good 

# full script neg log
	- only change is the introduction of non-length dependent sigma's for negative loglikelihood
	- parameterised
	- only computed with Nelder-Mead
	- initial fits are decent 
	- fishing selectivity curve not great
	- F is probably too low, but now captures correct pattern 
	- Abundance looks better 
	- Survey catchability is a diagonal straight line around 5.39 - 5.45
	- aggregated survey is a little worse 

# full script length dependent neg log 
	- only change is survey evaluation uses length-dependent sigma's for negative loglikelihood
	- parameterised 
	- computed with both Nelder-Mead and BFGS
	- length-structured survey fit is a bit shaky
	- Fishing selectivity curve looks good
	- F looks on a good scale and correct pattern 
	- Abundance is definitely too low 
	- Survey catchability is a straight line at 1.2 
	- aggregated survey is OK 

# full script length dependent neg log tensor spline
	- only change is introduction of tensor spline to replace logistic curve for estimating F
	- parameterised
	- computed with Nelder-Mead, BFGS, CG and L-BFGS-B
	- all four of which have really nice initial fits - the first three all found the same neg log value
	- F is now very strange though - first year is way too high 
	- Abundance looks good
	- survey catchability is a straight line at 0.33
	- aggregated survey is OK

# full script length dependent neg log tensor spline 2018
	- an attempt to include the 2017 and 2018 survey data
	- may not be the best parameters
	- computed with Nelder-Mead, BFGS, CG and L-BFGS-B
	
# full script length dependent neg log tensor spline alternative survey estimate
	- doesn't work 
	- trying to avoid using logistic curve for survey selectivity as this has been consistently problematic
